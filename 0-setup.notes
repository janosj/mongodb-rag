This repo adds some convenience scripts to make it easier to launch and demo. Some initial setup steps are still required:

  1. Copy the key_param.py.EXAMPLE file to key_param.py and supply your openAI API key and MONGO_URI.

  2. Create a sample_files folder and the initial 3 sample documents as directed in the original blog.

  3. Run the scripts to install the python packages and load the sample documents.

  4. Create the vector index manually. See the corresponding notes file for the index definition. 

  5. Run the app. If you retain the collection and vector index in your Atlas cluster, this is all you'll have to do on for subsequent demonstrations.
